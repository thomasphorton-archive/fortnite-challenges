# Fortnite Challenges Tracker
There isn't a good UI for tracking challenges once you get in-game in Fortnite- I found myself creating a text file and marking them off as I went.

This project deploys a basic page that has checkboxes for each challenge. You can keep it open on another monitor or on your phone as you play.

Pull Requests for additional features are welcome!
