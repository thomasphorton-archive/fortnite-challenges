# Archived: Fortnite Challenges Tracker

Back in early Fortnite days, the game had weekly challenges but no way to view them once you were in a match. I created this tracker to help out with that. Got some decent traffic! Sometime around Season 4/5 they added an in-game tracker, so this was no longer needed. Fun while it lasted!

## Old README

There isn't a good UI for tracking challenges once you get in-game in Fortnite- I found myself creating a text file and marking them off as I went.

This project deploys a basic page that has checkboxes for each challenge. You can keep it open on another monitor or on your phone as you play.
